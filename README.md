# Betting-Game
This is my first cpp repository which i named as Betting Game.
 betting  of something of value, with consciousness of risk and hope of gain, on the outcome of a game, a contest, or an uncertain event whose result may be determined by chance.
 in this program user have to first enter their name and the total amount after that user have to enter a valid betting amount if you won't system will ask you again and again to enter until you enter valid amount.
 Now , user will select a number between 1 and 10,again if u enter invalid input same process will done by system, 
 now system will generate a lucky number randomly between 1 to 10 and if your guess is same then you will win 10 times of your betting amount but if wrong bet then you will lose all your betting amount.
 
 try it and enjoy, and leave some comment whether it is good or somewhere i can improve something in this.
